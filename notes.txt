  "If a file's name, after stripping the extension and a possible _test
  suffix, matches any of the following patterns:

  *_GOOS
  *_GOARCH
  *_GOOS_GOARCH

  (example: source_windows_amd64.go) where GOOS and GOARCH represent any
  known operating system and architecture values respectively, then the
  file is considered to have an implicit build constraint requiring those
  terms (in addition to any explicit constraints in the file)."

  Above is relevant to "wtf, why is cgo darwin broken, what includes those
  files in github.com/rubrikinc/go-pcre; and how does it pick them.
